* **"Enterprise" / "B2B"** → Security, compliance, on-premise options
* **"SaaS" / "Cloud"** → Multi-tenant, auto-scaling, global distribution

## **Industry Patterns:**
* **Healthcare** → HIPAA compliance, data sovereignty, high availability
* **Finance** → Low latency, regulatory compliance, real-time processing
* **Manufacturing** → Edge deployment, rugged hardware, industrial networking
* **Retail/E-commerce** → High availability, seasonal scaling, personalization
* **Security** → Encryption, audit trails, compliance frameworks

## **Funding Stage Indicators:**
* **"Seed" / "Pre-seed" / "Angel"** → Seed stage, cloud cost optimization, basic automation
* **"Series A"** → Series A, hybrid cloud, performance optimization, early enterprise
* **"Series B"** → Series B, enterprise security, advanced monitoring, scaling
* **"Series C" / "Series D" / "Series E"** → Scale stage, on-premise, custom hardware, global distribution
* **"Startup" / "Early stage"** → Likely seed/Series A, cloud cost optimization
* **"Scale" / "Enterprise"** → Likely Series C+, on-premise, custom hardware

## **Common Pain Points by Pattern:**
* **High GPU usage** → Cloud cost explosion, performance bottlenecks
* **Real-time processing** → Latency issues, scaling challenges
* **Large data volumes** → Storage costs, I/O bottlenecks
* **Global users** → Multi-region deployment, data sovereignty
* **Enterprise customers** → Compliance requirements, security needs
